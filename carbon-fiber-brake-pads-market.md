<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber Brake Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Threaded Post Brake Pads</li><li>Non-threaded Post Brake Pads</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon fiber brake pads are divided into two main types based on their connection to the brake system: Threaded Post Brake Pads and Non-threaded Post Brake Pads. Threaded Post Brake Pads have a built-in threaded post that screws directly into the brake caliper, providing a secure connection. On the other hand, Non-threaded Post Brake Pads use a separate bolt to secure the pad to the caliper. Both types offer high performance and durability, with Threaded Post Brake Pads being easier to install and replace.</p></p>
