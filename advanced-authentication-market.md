<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Advanced Authentication Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi-Factor Authentication</li><li>Biometrics</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Multi-factor authentication is a type of advanced authentication that requires users to provide two or more forms of identification before gaining access to a system or application. This could include something the user knows, such as a password, something the user has, such as a smart card, or something the user is, such as a fingerprint or facial recognition. Biometrics, on the other hand, uses unique physical characteristics like fingerprints or iris scans to verify a person's identity. Both technologies enhance security by adding extra layers of protection against unauthorized access.</p></p>
