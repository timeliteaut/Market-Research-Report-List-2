<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Shunt Reactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Oil-Immersed</li><li>Air-Core</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Shunt reactors are classified into two main types - Oil-Immersed and Air-Core. Oil-Immersed shunt reactors use mineral oil as a cooling and insulating medium, making them suitable for high power applications. They are commonly used in high voltage transmission systems. On the other hand, Air-Core shunt reactors do not use any insulating liquid, instead relying on air for cooling. They are more environmentally friendly and are often used in renewable energy systems. Both types play a crucial role in maintaining power system stability and voltage regulation.</p></p>
