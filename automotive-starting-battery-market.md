<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automotive Starting Battery Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Maintenance-free Battery</li><li>Conventional Battery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automotive starting batteries can be classified into two main types: maintenance-free batteries and conventional batteries. Maintenance-free batteries require no water refills, making them more convenient for consumers. They boast longer lifespans and improved performance compared to conventional batteries. On the other hand, conventional batteries require periodic maintenance in the form of water refills. While they may be less expensive, they have a shorter lifespan and may not offer the same level of convenience as maintenance-free batteries. Both types cater to different consumer needs and preferences in the automotive starting battery market.</p></p>
