<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The File Integrity Monitoring Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Agent-based</li><li>Agent-less</li></ul></p>
<p><p>File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) tools can be categorized into two main types: Agent-based and Agent-less. Agent-based FIM solutions work by installing a small software agent on each monitored system, which continuously scans and monitors files for changes. On the other hand, Agent-less FIM solutions operate without the need for software agents, instead relying on network-based monitoring techniques to track file modifications. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of deployment complexity, resource usage, and scalability.</p></p>
